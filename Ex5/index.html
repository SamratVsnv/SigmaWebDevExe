            <h1>Krishna</h1>
            <p>
                Lord Shree Krishna is known as a Vasudev, a divine being who, though fully engaged in the world,
                remains untouched by its attachments and is worthy of ultimate liberation—moksha. A Vasudev
                possesses unimaginable superhuman energies and spiritual accomplishments. Such is their power that
                even a single glance from them can strike awe and fear into the hearts of thousands.
                Shree Krishna, though He had sixteen thousand queens, was a naishthik brahmachari—one with a firm,
                unwavering inner intent of celibacy. His actions in the world may appear outwardly non-celibate, but
                His inner resolve was eternally pure, rooted in self-mastery and divine detachment.
                This principle reveals a deeper spiritual truth: what truly binds karma is not the external act, but
                the inner intent. Just as a man who steals yet harbors a constant inner desire not to steal is said
                to practice naishthik achauriya (innate non-stealing), so too, the Lord’s inner state remained
                stainless. Conversely, even a charitable act done with selfish motives binds new karma, whereas
                Krishna’s every action was rooted in selfless divine intent.
                Indeed, all that is perceived through the five senses holds no true value in shaping future karma.
                It is one’s inner bhav (intent) that creates the future. In Lord Krishna, this inner intent was
                perfectly aligned with the highest spiritual truth.
                Thus, it was through such divine purity that God—the pure Soul—manifested in Lord Krishna, and from
                Nar (a human), He rose to become Narayan (the Supreme Divine)!

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Svayam Bhagavān), is the most worshipable and beloved Lord
                among all the demigods and divine personalities in the Vedic tradition. Although He is sometimes
                described as the eighth avatāra of Lord Viṣṇu, the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava sampradāya, following the teachings
                of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, reveres Him not merely as an incarnation but as the original source of all
                incarnations—Kṛṣṇas tu Bhagavān svayam (Bhāgavatam 1.3.28).

                Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the very heart of the bhakti movement, and His transcendental pastimes have inspired
                innumerable waves of devotional service, divine poetry, sacred music (like kīrtana and bhajana), and
                beautiful art glorifying His form, qualities, and līlās. His divine activities are most elaborately
                described in the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (Bhāgavata Purāṇa), especially in Cantos 10 and 11, which are
                considered the essence of all Vedic literature by the followers of pure devotion.

                The all-attractive Lord appeared in this world in His original form in the Yadu dynasty as the son of
                Śrī Vasudeva and Devakī-devī, in the sacred city of Mathurā-dhāma. This divine appearance was in
                response to the prayers of the demigods and the intense suffering of Mother Earth. At the time, the
                demoniac king Kaṁsa, Devakī’s own brother, had usurped the throne and was terrorizing the world. Hearing
                a divine prophecy that he would be slain by Devakī’s child, Kaṁsa imprisoned the couple and began
                killing their offspring.

                However, by the arrangement of Yogamāyā, the Lord’s eternal internal potency, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was miraculously
                transferred across the Yamunā River on a stormy night and placed under the loving care of Nanda Mahārāja
                and Mother Yaśodā in the sacred land of Vraja-dhāma (Gokula). There, He performed His enchanting
                childhood pastimes—stealing butter, herding cows, and delighting the Vrajavāsīs—captivating the hearts
                of all living beings and revealing the supreme sweetness of the Lord in His original form as a cowherd
                boy.</p>

            <h1>Bhagwat Geeta</h1>
            <p>Bhagavad-gītā is also known as Gītopaniṣad. It is the essence of Vedic knowledge and one of the most
                important Upaniṣads in Vedic literature. Of course there are many commentaries in English on the
                Bhagavad-gītā, and one may question the necessity for another one. This present edition can be explained
                in the following way. Recently an American lady asked me to recommend an English translation of
                Bhagavad-gītā. Of course in America there are so many editions of Bhagavad-gītā available in English,
                but as far as I have seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly said to
                be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator has expressed his own opinions
                without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gītā as it is.
                The spirit of Bhagavad-gītā is mentioned in Bhagavad-gītā itself. It is just like this: If we want to
                take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the directions written on the label. We cannot take
                the medicine according to our own whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the
                directions on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly, Bhagavad-gītā should be taken
                or accepted as it is directed by the speaker Himself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gītā is Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He
                is mentioned on every page of Bhagavad-gītā as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān. Of course
                the word bhagavān sometimes refers to any powerful person or any powerful demigod, and certainly here
                bhagavān designates Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as a great personality, but at the same time we should know that Lord
                Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great ācāryas (spiritual
                masters) like Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka Svāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and many
                other authorities of Vedic knowledge in India. The Lord Himself also establishes Himself as the Supreme
                Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gītā, and He is accepted as such in the Brahma-saṁhitā and all
                the Purāṇas, especially the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, known as the Bhāgavata Purāṇa (kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān
                svayam). Therefore we should take Bhagavad-gītā as it is directed by the Personality of Godhead Himself.

                Bhagwate Geeta Slokas for tech guys like me

                BG 2.47

                कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।
                मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥

                Translation:
                You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your
                actions. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to
                inaction.

                BG 2.48

                योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय।
                सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते॥

                Translation:
                Perform your duties established in yoga, O Arjuna, abandoning attachment and remaining even-minded in
                success and failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.

                BG 2.58

                यदा संहरते चायं कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वशः।
                इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता॥

                Translation:
                When, like a tortoise that draws its limbs inward, one withdraws the senses from the sense objects, his
                wisdom becomes steady.

                BG 4.20

                त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रयः।
                कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किंचित्करोति सः॥

                Translation:
                Having given up attachment to the fruits of action, always content, and independent, the wise one is not
                bound, even while engaging in work.
